# React Portfolio

![License Badge](https://badgen.net/static/license/MIT/blue)

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a portfolio using my React skills, which will help set me apart from other developers whose portfolios donâ€™t use the latest technologies. The application will be deployed using Netlify.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

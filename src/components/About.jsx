            This is a simple project that I created to showcase my skills as a developer. I created this project using React,
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also used React-Scroll to create smooth scrolling. I also used React-Type-Animation to create a typewriter effect on the About Me section.
            I also used React-Icons to create icons for the navigation bar. 
        </p>
    </div>

export default About;
